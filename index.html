				<h3>Complements or Substitues: Greenbelt and Congestion Charge Policy For Post-pandemic City Regions - Insights From A New Spatial</h3>
				<h4>Yibin Li</h4>
				<p> This research switches the policy assessment from the single city and one policy analysis into a multi-policy city-regional scale assessment by considering the city network, 
					different hierarchical city levels, and policy scenario comparison. The changing preferences for city-center and suburban amenities and the popularity of remote work in the 
					post-pandemic are two new challenges to existing SCGE models. Those two new challenges on existing SCGE models have been considered in this research to model the public location choice and urban spatial structure.</p>

				<h3>Developing a New Spatial Equilibrium Model for quantifying the Energy Impacts of Alternative Urban Spatial Planning Strategies for Fast-growing City Regions: A Case Study of Greater Beijing, China</h3>
				<h4>Qiancheng Wang</h4>
				<p> This study builds on the activity-based approach in transport modelling and expands it as a unified analytical framework for quantifying the effects of the land-use and transport planning on long-term city-scale energy intensity in fast-growing city regions. 
				The new modelling framework features a consistent activity-based choice model linking the building and transport sector, subject to explicit time and budget constraints and spatial equilibrium condition in the housing market. The study demonstrates the policy use of the model through an empirical model application for the Greater Beijing in China and estimates the carbon/energy intensity elasticities with respect to planning policy variables with the base-year model after calibration. The calibrated model will then be used to estimate the emission/energy outlook based on a series of urban spatial development scenarios and to test the magnitude and rate of technological and behavioural change required for achieving local sustainability goals.

				<h3>Examine the Spatial Economic Impact of Singaporeâ€™s Ethnicity Integration Policy</h3>
				<h4>Shantong Wang</h4>
				<p>The study aims to quantitatively assess the spatial and economic impact of Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) on the development of housing market and urban spatial structure in Singapore. 
				Specifically, two main research questions are proposed. (1) Whether EIP would have an impact on the spatial pattern and time-series changes of housing price in Singapore? If so, how would EIP affect the development of urban spatial structure in Singapore through its impact on the housing market?
				(2) How to mitigate/enhance the negative/positive impact of EIP in relation to the 2030 planning goals in Singapore? 
				The research design includes three main work packages, population synthesis, modelling residential location choice under housing market equilibrium and policy scenario analysis.</p>

				<h3>Explore the causal relationship between land use and the quality of infrastructure services: analysis of over 200 cities in China</h3>
				<h4>Tianyuan Wang</h4>
				<p>The theoretical interaction between land-use and urban infrastructure is articulate in literature, 
					but the coordination of the two policy domains remains a challenging task in planning practice. 
					The fast urbanisation in Chinese cities features a distinct land finance model, where land supply, employment growth, 
					government revenue and infrastructure investment constitute a complex nexus of interdependences. This research aims to address this gap by quantifying the potential causal relationships between land-use planning, employment and urban infrastructure service mediated by two main government revenue accounts for over 200 prefecture-level cities in mainland China. By incorporating latent classes of cities in a series of structural equation models (SEM), this research confirms that 1) land-use planning is a significant variable that affects the development of urban infrastructure services through land finance, and 2) there is significant cross-city heterogeneity on the role of land-use planning in influencing employment and infrastructure growth. 
				    This study provides new policy insights on the varying efficiency of land use across cities.</p>

				<h3>An interdisciplinary method for generating large-scale longitudinal urban expansion data using night-time light data â€“ A case study of 600+ Chinese cities</h3>
				<h4>Zengquan Li</h4>
				<p>Night-time light (NTL) data provide a novel and accessible source for monitoring the Spatio-temporal dynamics of urban expansion. The static thresholds ignore the path-dependent nature of urban development. Using NTL data for 2012-2018, this study proposes a new method using dynamic threshold (DT) for extracting UBA using NTL data for 600+ Chinese cities. 
				The dynamic thresholds explicitly address the temporal continuity of urban physical development and further consider intra-city heterogeneity in terms of NTL brightness change pattern. 
				Through a comparison with official statistics in China and UN-Habitat Sentinel-2 Human Settlement data, it is demonstrated that the overall accuracy of the DT method exceeds 85%, and the Kappa index exceeds 0.45. </p>

				<h4>Ling Li and Wan Li (2021)</h4>
				<p> This paper studies the spatial impact of COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of intra-city population and house rent changes in Beijing, China. Drawing on multiple geospatial data sets, we find that the pandemic has flattened the housing bid-rent curve in Beijing, which corroborates existing literature mainly based on cities in developed countries. Through regression analysis and spatial equilibrium modelling, we identify key mechanisms of the flattened bid-rent curve and the accompanying decentralisation of residents. First, workplace population change, particularly in central Beijing, seems to be the main factor contributing to the resident population and house rent changes. Second, we find no significant evidence on the spatial impact from remote working, as the share of remote working in Beijing appears low after about one year recovery. This finding contrasts to existing studies where remote working has been perceived as the main driver for urban spatial structure change in a developed country context. Third, through a novel method for quantifying locational preference changes, it is found that the observed decentralisation trend in Beijing, ceteris paribus, may also be associated with increased (decreased) preference for living in suburban (central) locations. However, the preference change for central locations is marginal, hence providing an early rebuttal of the â€˜demise of centresâ€™ proposition.</p>
