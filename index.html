				<h3>Developing a New Spatial Equilibrium Model for quantifying the Energy Impacts of Alternative Urban Spatial Planning Strategies for Fast-growing City Regions: A Case Study of Greater Beijing, China</h3>
				<h4>Qiancheng Wang</h4>
				<p> This study builds on the activity-based approach in transport modelling and expands it as a unified analytical framework for quantifying the effects of the land-use and transport planning on long-term city-scale energy intensity in fast-growing city regions. 
				The new modelling framework features a consistent activity-based choice model linking the building and transport sector, subject to explicit time and budget constraints and spatial equilibrium condition in the housing market. The study demonstrates the policy use of the model through an empirical model application for the Greater Beijing in China and estimates the carbon/energy intensity elasticities with respect to planning policy variables with the base-year model after calibration. The calibrated model will then be used to estimate the emission/energy outlook based on a series of urban spatial development scenarios and to test the magnitude and rate of technological and behavioural change required for achieving local sustainability goals.

				<h3>Examine the Spatial Economic Impact of Singapore’s Ethnicity Integration Policy</h3>
				<h4>Shantong Wang</h4>
				<p>The study aims to quantitatively assess the spatial and economic impact of Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) on the development of housing market and urban spatial structure in Singapore. 
				Specifically, two main research questions are proposed. (1) Whether EIP would have an impact on the spatial pattern and time-series changes of housing price in Singapore? If so, how would EIP affect the development of urban spatial structure in Singapore through its impact on the housing market?
				(2) How to mitigate/enhance the negative/positive impact of EIP in relation to the 2030 planning goals in Singapore? 
				The research design includes three main work packages, population synthesis, modelling residential location choice under housing market equilibrium and policy scenario analysis.</p>

				<h3>Explore the causal relationship between land use and the quality of infrastructure services: analysis of over 200 cities in China</h3>
				<h4>Tianyuan Wang</h4>
				<p>The theoretical interaction between land-use and urban infrastructure is articulate in literature, 
					but the coordination of the two policy domains remains a challenging task in planning practice. 
					The fast urbanisation in Chinese cities features a distinct land finance model, where land supply, employment growth, 
					government revenue and infrastructure investment constitute a complex nexus of interdependences. This research aims to address this gap by quantifying the potential causal relationships between land-use planning, employment and urban infrastructure service mediated by two main government revenue accounts for over 200 prefecture-level cities in mainland China. By incorporating latent classes of cities in a series of structural equation models (SEM), this research confirms that 1) land-use planning is a significant variable that affects the development of urban infrastructure services through land finance, and 2) there is significant cross-city heterogeneity on the role of land-use planning in influencing employment and infrastructure growth. 
				    This study provides new policy insights on the varying efficiency of land use across cities.</p>

				<h3>An interdisciplinary method for generating large-scale longitudinal urban expansion data using night-time light data – A case study of 600+ Chinese cities</h3>
				<h4>Zengquan Li</h4>
				<p>Night-time light (NTL) data provide a novel and accessible source for monitoring the Spatio-temporal dynamics of urban expansion. The static thresholds ignore the path-dependent nature of urban development. Using NTL data for 2012-2018, this study proposes a new method using dynamic threshold (DT) for extracting UBA using NTL data for 600+ Chinese cities. 
				The dynamic thresholds explicitly address the temporal continuity of urban physical development and further consider intra-city heterogeneity in terms of NTL brightness change pattern. 
				Through a comparison with official statistics in China and UN-Habitat Sentinel-2 Human Settlement data, it is demonstrated that the overall accuracy of the DT method exceeds 85%, and the Kappa index exceeds 0.45. </p>

				<h3>Estimating commuting matrix and error mitigation – A complementary use of aggregate travel survey, location-based big data and discrete choice models</h3>
				<h4>#Matrix estimation #Commuting #Location-based big data #Mobile phone data #Transport modelling</h4>
				<p>The prevalence of location-based big data has opened a new research frontier for estimating origin–destination commuting matrices for cities where granular flow data are not yet available from official sources. However, investigations into estimation errors and potential correction methods have been rare in the literature. To address the research gap, this paper first compares the performance of two estimated commuting matrices for Shanghai, derived by two distinct matrix estimation methods, namely a big-data approach using mobile phone signalling data and a discrete choice model for simulating the residential location of commuters. The empirical results indicate an outstanding analytical complementarity of the two approaches. A novel method is then proposed for mitigating the errors associated with the big-data approach. The proposed method features a selective blending of the big-data based flow estimation and the model-based estimation. By comparing the blended flow estimation with benchmark travel statistics, we find that the proposed method would significantly reduce the estimation errors and hence improve the robustness of the estimated matrix. It is expected that the proposed method will set a new standard for correcting potential errors in big-data based flow estimation. </p>

			    <h3>Understanding non-commuting travel demand of car commuters – Insights from ANPR trip chain data in Cambridge</h3>
                <h4>#Travel demand #ANPR #Traffic sensing #Transport modelling #Commuting travel</h4>
                <p>The paper investigates the non-commuting travel demand of car commuters using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) trip chain data in Cambridge, UK. A novel rule-based algorithm is developed for identifying commuting vehicles and the associated non-commuting trips. Identification results are validated with external data. Non-commuting travel demand is investigated in terms of trip probability, average trip frequency, duration and demand elasticity. The study finds that, first, non-commuting trips represent a significant source of travel demand for car commuters – car commuters who engage in non-commuting activities in their daily trip chains would on average spend approximately 2.7hr on those activities including travel time on a typical workday in Cambridge. Second, longer working hours are associated with a lower probability of engaging in non-commuting trips, implying a substitution effect within the daily travel time budget. Last, in terms of travel demand elasticity, non-commuting trips starting in the early morning (6–9am) are less elastic than those starting in the morning (9–12am) and during the lunch break (12-3pm). The varying demand elasticities are likely to be attributed to the different travel constraints associated with certain trip purposes. Implications for post-pandemic traffic demand and management are drawn.</p>

			<h3>Big Data and Urban System Model – Substitutes or Complements? A Case Study of Modelling Commuting Patterns in Beijing</h3>
			<h4>#Big dataSpatial equilibrium #Land-use and transport model #Commuting</h4>
			<p>The emergence of urban big data is transforming the existing research paradigms in urban studies. New theories and analytical methods are required to meet the methodological challenges. This paper empirically compares a data-driven approach and an urban-system-model approach through a case study of modelling the commuting patterns in Beijing. For the data-driven approach, the novel location-based-services (LBS) data are explored to identify the employment-residence location of the service users. For the modelling approach, a spatial equilibrium model is calibrated for base year 2010 and is used to simulate the commuting patterns for Beijing 2015 based on exogenous development projections. The results of the two approaches are then compared against the benchmark statistics for Beijing 2015. The comparison shows that the LBS data perform better in detecting residence locations than employment locations. The model prediction fits better with the benchmark, while the errors of the LBS data tend to vary significantly across space. For amplifying the LBS sample data to represent the full population, uniform scale factor thus should be avoided. In addition, the ineffectiveness of representing short-distance commuting for the LBS data is revealed by the comparison with the model predicted flows. In light of the strength and weakness of the respective approach, the prospect of a collaborative use of big data and urban system models is explored in the conclusion.</p>

            <h4>#Digital twins #Urban modeling #Urban governance #Socio-technical perspective</h4>
            <p>This paper demonstrates that a shift from a purely technical to a more socio-technical perspective has significant implications for the conceptualization, design, and implementation of smart city technologies. Such implications are discussed and illustrated through the case of an emerging urban analytics tool, the City-scale Digital Twin. Based on interdisciplinary insights and a participatory knowledge co-production and tool co-development process, including both researchers and prospective users, we conclude that in order to move beyond a mere “hype technology,” City-Scale Digital Twins must reflect the specifics of the urban and socio-political context.</p>

            <h3>Exploring Resilient Observability in Traffic-Monitoring Sensor Networks: A Study of Spatial–Temporal Vehicle Patterns</h3>
            <h4>#Vehicle mobility #Resilience #Spatial–temporal analysis #Traffic-monitoring sensors #Sensor networks</h4>
            <p>Vehicle mobility generates dynamic and complex patterns that are associated with our day-to-day activities in cities. To reveal the spatial–temporal complexity of such patterns, digital techniques, such as traffic-monitoring sensors, provide promising data-driven tools for city managers and urban planners. Although a large number of studies have been dedicated to investigating the sensing power of the traffic-monitoring sensors, there is still a lack of exploration of the resilient performance of sensor networks when multiple sensor failures occur. In this paper, we reveal the dynamic patterns of vehicle mobility in Cambridge, UK, and subsequently, explore the resilience of the sensor networks. The observability is adopted as the overall performance indicator to depict the maximum number of vehicles captured by the deployed sensors in the study area. By aggregating the sensor networks according to weekday and weekend and simulating random sensor failures with different recovery strategies, we found that (1) the day-to-day vehicle mobility pattern in this case study is highly dynamic and decomposed journey durations follow a power-law distribution on the tail section; (2) such temporal variation significantly affects the observability of the sensor network, causing its overall resilience to vary with different recovery strategies. The simulation results further suggest that a corresponding prioritization for recovering the sensors from massive failures is required, rather than a static sequence determined by the first-fail–first-repair principle. For stakeholders and decision-makers, this study provides insightful implications for understanding city-scale vehicle mobility and the resilience of traffic-monitoring sensor networks.</p>

            <h3>Developing A City-level Digital Twin - Propositions and A Case Study</h3>
            <p>Inspired by the UK National Infrastructure Commission’s ambition of building a “digital twin” for the national infrastructure,
this paper reviews some of the latest progress on digital twin development in the UK, particularly the recently published report “The Gemini
Principles” by the Centre for Digital Built Britain. The paper further puts forwards six propositions on the city-level digital twin agenda, which
stem from an ongoing research project on smart cities at the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction. It is argued that the
development of a digital twin is progressive, where the digital twin as a technical apparatus and the social system that develops, operates and
uses the digital twin must co-evolve together. On the one hand, our existing knowledge about cities and infrastructure would define how well
we could build and evaluate the digital twin; on the other hand, thanks to artificial intelligence, the digital twin could potentially produce new
knowledge that complements ours. In the context of developing smart cities, the paper points out that the digital twin is not a context-free
technology that can be simply purchased and installed onto existing governance systems. To develop a purposeful digital twin application, the
insights and changes from the governance perspective are essential. The paper also introduces the research plan for developing a digital twin
pilot for the Cambridge sub-region, which serves as a case study to test the proposed propositions.</p>

            <h3>Confusion of Goals — Rethinking the Implication of Data Analytics and Modelling for Urban Planning and Design Industry</h3>
            <h4>#Big Data #Data Analytics #Urban Modelling #Socio-Technical #Urban Planning #Urban Design</h4>
            <p>Inspired by the fast take-up of data analytics and modelling in urban planning and design in Chinese cities, this paper aims to address a serious knowledge gap in terms of using data to deliver better policy outcomes rather than technical outputs. Such a knowledge gap is discussed in the wider context of smart city development where technology deployment failed to deliver the expected policy benefits. Lessons thus can be, and should be, learnt from early experiments to prevent the data revolution in planning and design in Chinese cities from repeating the same failure. One of the key arguments is that, in order to leverage the potential power of data and analytics for the urban planning and design industry, a wider theoretical framework is required for rethinking the core role as well as core competence of the planning profession in China. It entails a diversion from the purely technical discourse and the disciplinary / professional silos, towards a sociotechnical perspective. A series of propositions are proposed to evoke more critical discussion about the digital agenda for urban planning and design.</p>

            <h3>Digitalisation for smarter cities: moving from a static to a dynamic view</h3>
            <h4>#Knowledge management #Local government town #City planning</h4>
            <p>This paper presents a critical review of the literature on smart cities informed by a sociotechnical perspective that views ‘smart city development’ as a dynamic change process that extends to both the technological apparatus of the city and the social environment that produces, maintains and uses it. The conclusions from the review are summarised in six propositions. The propositions contest the mainstream discourse that often culminates in a utopian vision where data collection, processing, analysis and sharing provide solutions to all urban problems and provide direction for the future advancement of smart city research and practice. Using the propositions as guidelines to underpin a multidisciplinary approach, the paper sets out a relational perspective based on notions of boundary spanning, coordination and management that can shed light on previously overlooked aspects of smart city transitions.</p>

            <h4>#Model validation #Satial equilibrium #Land use transportation interaction (LUTI) models #Recursive dynamics #Model calibration #Urban Modelling</h4>
            <p>Robust calibration and validation of applied urban models are prerequisites for their successful, policy-cogent use. This is particularly important today when expert assessment is questioned and closely scrutinized. This paper proposes a new model calibration-validation strategy based on a spatial equilibrium model that incorporates multiple time horizons, such that the predictive capabilities of the model can be empirically tested. The model is implemented for the Greater Beijing city region and the model validation strategy is demonstrated over the Census years 2000 to 2010. Through forward/backward forecasting, the model validation helps to verify the stability of the model parameters as well as the predictive capabilities of the recursive equilibrium framework. The proposed modelling strategy sets a new standard for verifying and validating recursive equilibrium models. We also consider the wider implications of the approach.</p>

            <h3>Environmental impacts of transformative land use and transport developments in the Greater Beijing Region: Insights from a new dynamic spatial equilibrium model.</h3>
            <h4>#Travel demand forecasting #Urban transport emissions #Transformative development #Land use/transport coordination #Land use dynamics #Spatial equilibrium model #Strategic transport model Greater Beijing</h4>
            <p>This paper reports the insights into environmental impacts of the ongoing transformative land use and transport developments in Greater Beijing, from a new suite of dynamic land use, spatial equilibrium and strategic transport models that is calibrated for medium to long term land use and transport predictions. The model tests are focused on urban passenger travel demand and associated emissions within the municipality of Beijing, accounting for Beijing’s land use and transport interactions with Tianjin, Hebei and beyond. The findings suggests that background trends of urbanization, economic growth and income rises will continue to be very powerful drivers for urban passenger travel demand across all main modes of transport beyond 2030. In order to achieve the dual policy aims for a moderately affluent and equitable nation and reducing the absolute levels of urban transport emissions by 2030, road charging and careful micro-level coordination between land use, built form and public transport provision may need to be considered together for policy implementation in the near future.</p>

            <h3>Monitoring Spatial Changes in Manufacturing Firms in Seoul Metropolitan Area Using Firm Life Cycle and Locational Factors</h3>
            <h4>#Firm’s life cycle #Locational factors #Manufacturing firms #Model calibration #Monitoring spatial changes</h4>
            <p> This paper diagnoses the development of the manufacturing industry in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) using portfolio and regression analyses. Following the life-cycle perspective, four types of spatial changes of firms have been identified, namely firm formation, inflow, outflow, and dissolution, which are applied to analyze the manufacturing development in SMA. For portfolio analysis, we propose the Net Formation Index and Net Inflow Index to measure the spatial changes of firms at the city level. The two indices facilitate horizontal comparison among cities in SMA in terms of firm growth from new opening and relocation. Using spatial regression analysis, we identify significant location factors that contribute to firm change patterns. Our tests show that a high level of industrial specialization (measured by location quotient) has a dual effect. On the one hand, high level specialization attracts new or inflow firms, particularly in the light and high-tech manufacturing industries. On the other hand, it leads to an increased number of closed or outflow firms, plausibly due to increased competition among local firms. The proposed methods can be applied to diagnose industrial development in clusters of inter-connected cities and design policy tools to boost the local industry.</p>

			<h3>Identifying the Growth Patterns of High-Tech Manufacturing Industry across Seoul Metropolitan Area Using Latent Class Analysis</h3>
            
            <p> Latent class analysis (LCA) is a well-established research method in social science for explaining observed correlations or variance by identifying latent classes, but it has rarely been applied in urban studies. This paper provides an empirical case of using LCA to identify the generic growth patterns of the high-tech manufacturing industry across locations in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA). The presented model uses standardized high-tech industry growth data processed from firm registration data in SMA (2009–2014) as outcome variables, and incorporates the initial high-tech firm density in 2009 as a covariate, aiming to explore the possible link between identified growth patterns and initial high-tech firm density. The authors found that during 2009–2014 continuous growth of the high-tech industry was more likely to occur in locations with relatively low initial high-tech firm density. As firm density rose, fewer locations could have sustaining growth but increasingly relied on certain triggers to achieve further growth. The probability of falling into industrial decline also increased as high-tech firm density grew. In addition, locations with relatively low high-tech firm density were more likely to experience big fluctuations. The methodology and the findings presented in this paper are expected to contribute to industrial location choices and development studies in similar metropolitan areas.
